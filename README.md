# Image Gallery Build Challenge

## Accessibility Considerations
To make the gallery more accessible, images can be opened in the modal by tabbing through and hitting enter. All buttons and links are tabbable, with clear :focus properites to indicate the current selection.

The slideshow can be started and paused with the space bar, and navigated with the arrow keys. The modal can be closed with the excape key.

## Scalability Concerns
The biggest concern as of now is displaying the pagination indicators. As the gallery continues to grow and more pages are created, the numbers would eventually run out of space. I would address this either by adding a dropdown selector, using navigation arrows instead of page numbers, or utilizing lazy loading to continuously display images as the user scrolls down the page. 

## Responsiveness
The gallery is fully responsive and adjust appropriately for any screen size.
